# jtt-m

## Requirements

The code is tested on Python 3.9 and PyTorch 1.10.1.
We recommend to create a new environment for experiments using conda:
```bash
conda create -y -n jtt-m python=3.9
conda activate jtt-m
```

Then, from the `jtt-m` project root, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For further development or modification, we recommend installing `pre-commit`:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

To ensure that PyTorch is installed and CUDA works properly, run:
```bash
python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__); print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

We should see:
```bash
1.10.1+cu111
True
```

:warning: We use PyTorch 1.10.1 with CUDA 11.0. You may need another CUDA version suitable for your environment.
